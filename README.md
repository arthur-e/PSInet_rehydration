Sundown until refilling (predawn) on the X-axis
Average water potential in that period (or Water potential at rehydration?) on the Y axis

Keff = -log(psi_t - psi_pd / (psi_gs - psi_pd)) (C / t)

- C is the average leaf capacitance
- psi_gs is the psi_leaf at nighttime stomatal closure (sundown)
- psi_pd at predawn or highest leaf water potential

Rehydration time constant is Keff/C

tau = R_0 * C
tau = C / Keff
